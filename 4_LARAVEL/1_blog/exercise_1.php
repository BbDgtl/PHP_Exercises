	We have an online books website

	- Step 1 :

	You have to create routes to :
		- Show all the books
		- Insert a new book
		This route should display a form with all the mandatory fields.
		When click on the submit button, insert the new book.
		- Delete a book
		You delete the book receiving an id. The route should look like this '/delete/3'

	- Step 2 :

		Edit the route that show all the books.
		Now, for each book, there is a link to 'edit' the book.

		You have to create a route to edit a book, it should looks like this '/update/4'
		On this page you have a form with all the fields (the fields should be filled with data from the book).

	- Step 3 :

		You will have to change the operations for Inserting and Updating.
        You should now do an ajax call when clicking on the submit button.
