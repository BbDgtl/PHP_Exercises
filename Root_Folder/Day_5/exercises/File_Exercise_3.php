		1. Create two files : 'signin.php' & 'home.php'

		2. In the 'signin.php' file, create a form with two input : email & password.
		This form will redirect to 'home.php'

		3. In 'home.php', you'll have to check :
			- If this user actually exists.
			- If he exists, check that both email/password are matching.
			- Display a message for both validations.

		For this part, you'll use the 'users.txt' file.
		TIPS : you can read the file and create an array of all the users...
