/*

Overview : 
	Create a page to view some flowers.
	We will have, in database, the tables Flowers and Users

	In the Flowers table, we will record: The name of the flowers and their prices
	In the Users table: The email address and hash password


Step 1: Connecting users
	We will not take into account the creation of the users, they will be created manually in the database.
	
	We will create a class \Flowers\User and a class \Flowers\Db\UserManager, to manage the connection.

	Connection page will look like this :
*/

if(isset($_POST['login']) && isset($_POST['password'])) {
    $userManager = new \Flowers\UserManager();
    $userLogged = $userManager->login($_POST['login'], $_POST['password']);

    if(!empty($userLogged)) {
        $_SESSION['user']['mail']   = $userLogged->getMail();
        $_SESSION['user']['id']     = $userLogged->getId();
    }
}

/*
	Method UserManager::login($login, $password) will return either a User object, if the connection succeed, either false.


Step 2 : Affichage des fleurs
	Create the page view-flowers.php
	The user is redirect to this page if the connection is successfull.
	Create classes \Flowers\Flower and \Flowers\Db\FlowerManager
	Method \Flowers\Db\FlowerManager::findAll() will retrieve all the flowers

Step 3 :
	Ask the teacher if you want... there is a next step.
